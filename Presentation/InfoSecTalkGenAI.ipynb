    "# Important Terms\n",
    "**Large Language Model (LLM):** A large language model refers to a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data and utilize deep learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks or transformers, to capture patterns and relationships within the language. These models are capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including language translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokens:** In the context of language models, tokens refer to the individual units or segments into which a given text is divided. These segments can be as small as single characters or as large as entire words or even longer phrases, depending on the specific tokenization strategy employed. For example, the sentence \"I love cats\" can be tokenized into four tokens: [\"I\", \"love\", \"cats\"]. Each token is assigned a numerical representation that the language model uses to process and understand the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding:** In natural language processing and machine learning, an embedding is a numerical representation of a word, sentence, or document. Embeddings are derived from the language model's training process, where words or subword units are mapped to dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. Embeddings capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words, allowing the model to understand the contextual meaning of the text. By representing words as vectors, embeddings enable mathematical operations to be performed on them, such as measuring similarity or performing arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Tuning:** Model tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, refers to the process of adjusting the settings or parameters of a machine learning model to optimize its performance on a given task or dataset. This involves selecting the appropriate values for various hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, regularization strength, and network architecture. The goal of model tuning is to find the configuration that yields the best results, such as improved accuracy or reduced loss, by iteratively adjusting the hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Temperature:** Model temperature is a parameter that affects the randomness or diversity of the output generated by a language model. It is often used in models with a softmax activation function, which converts model outputs into probabilities. A higher temperature value, such as 1.0, increases the randomness of the generated text, resulting in more varied and exploratory outputs. Conversely, a lower temperature value, such as 0.5, decreases randomness and tends to produce more focused and deterministic responses. Adjusting the model temperature allows for controlling the trade-off between creativity and coherence in the generated text."

The tool scans the source code and known vulnerable code. For each identified vulnerability, the AI recommends remediation. It receives the code snippet, understands the vulnerability type, and provides the developer with a walkthrough of the vulnerability and a recommended remediation. Once the remediation is applied, the scan is rerun to check if the issue was resolved. \n",

    "While predicting the future is always a risky business, it's exciting to imagine the potential implications of generative AI. We envision a future where developers and engineers might spend less time writing code and more time on specifications and algorithms. Higher level languages, such as TLA+, could be used for testing these specifications and algorithms, with code being generated mostly by tools like generative AI. This could shift the nature of our work significantly, leading to new modes of problem-solving and development."
