The tool scans the source code and known vulnerable code. For each identified vulnerability, the AI recommends remediation. It receives the code snippet, understands the vulnerability type, and provides the developer with a walkthrough of the vulnerability and a recommended remediation. Once the remediation is applied, the scan is rerun to check if the issue was resolved. \n",
